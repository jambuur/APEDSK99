# APEDSK99

### *February 2023: MAJOR UPDATE in progress*

Check the TI Italian User Club for a review of the new version: https://www.ti99iuc.it/web/index.php?pagina=articoli&artid=219#.Y-gqDi9BxaS

Currently working on updating this Github page, Youtube channel etc. Biggest takeaway is that APEDSK99 is now pretty much plug and play. 
I am thinking of either supplying pre-assembled APEDSK99 shields, leaving it to you to source a cheap Arduino UNO + Ethernet Shield combo from Ebay, AliExpress etc.
Alternatively, I could supply complete kits; I have also been approached by a web shop interested in the same. 
Stay tuned :-) 

### *Arduino DSKx emulator / 32K / FTP / NTP shield for the TI99/4a*

APEDSK99 is an Arduino shield that emulates 3 DS/DD/80T floppy drives for the TI99/4a home computer. Combined with a Ethernet / SD shield it allows you to load and save Disk-On-A-Disk (DOAD) floppy images on a SD card or FTP server. It includes the necessary 32K RAM expansion and adds NTP date and time to BASIC. The APEDSK99 shield plugs directly into the side port and is powered separately from a USB cable.

Like the TI, APEDSK99 is based on good old through-hole technology. The TI<->shield interface is the familiar design, with 74HCT541 buffers for address lines and a bi-directional 74LS245 buffer for the databus.  A 64Kx8 RAM stores the DSR code and provides the 32K RAM expansion. CRU is emulated through memory mapped addresses, simplifying shield design. A user-selectable binary DSR file is loaded into RAM by the Arduino at powerup / reset. 

The Arduino UNO controls the TI interface, has R/W access to RAM, can halt the TI and tries to act as a FD1771. As GPIO pins are in rather short supply, Arduino RAM addressing is serial-to-parallel through 74HC595 shift registers. 

A status LED indicates APEDSK99 access as well as showing possible error codes.

The DSR is still very much the original TI Disk Controller ROM, but adapted to interface with a reliable SD card instead of wonky floppies. 
DSR code optimisation made enough RAM available to include some useful BASIC CALL routines. I think it's rather nice that most of the orginal programmers' blood, sweat and tears lives on.

### *How does it work?*

When the TI issues disk controller commands by writing to the various FD1771 registers, the Arduino receives an interrupt on one of its GPO pins. This interrupt is generated by a GAL which monitors A0, A13, A14, A15, WE* and MEMEN* sideport signals. On receiving an interrupt, the Arduino then:

1. halts the TI by making READY low; this simultaneously enables the shift registers
2. disables the sideport interface buffers
3. enables the Arduino RAM control bus
4. executes the command including updating the relevant FD1771 and CRU "registers"
5. executes the opposite of steps 3, 2 and 1

### *DOAD's*

DOAD's are stored in root folders on the SD card or on a FTP server. Default APEDSK99 files include a DISKS folder with a bunch of useful images to get you started. DOAD filenames must follow the DOS 8.3 format and have a ".DSK" extension. At powerup or reset the Arduino looks for optional "__APEDSK1.DSK" / "_APEDSK2.DSK" / "_APEDSK3.DSK" files and maps them accordingly so you can have your favourite apps ready to go. The DSR has support for DOAD management through TI BASIC CALL's (see below).

Once a DOAD is mapped to a particular DSK, it behaves very much like a normal (but rather speedy) floppy. 

Regarding FTP, on my setup (a Linux server with VSFTP within the same LAN segment) I get about ~22Kbyte upload / download speed. In practice it means 6-7 seconds between the TI-BASIC FTP CALL for a SS/SD image and back to the friendly flashing cursor.

### *BASIC support*

The DSR includes additional TI BASIC CALL's to manage DOAD's. There is really only one to remember and that's **CALL AHLP**; it shows the following help screen:
<p align="center">
  <img width="576" src=img/AHLPv2.jpg>
</p>

**CALL ARST** resets APEDSK99 including reloading the current DSR. It is a handy way to get your DOAD mappings to their initial state. It is functionally the same as pressing the Arduino reset button and sort of the same but not really as power cycling. 

**CALL LDIR** list the DOAD's in the current selected directory on the SD card (next screen = SPACE, back to the prompt = ENTER):
<p align="center">
  <img width="576" src=img/LDIR.jpg>
</p>

**CALL SMAP** shows the current DSKx -> DOAD mappings plus extended info and the available directories on the SD Card:
<p align="center">
  <img width="576" src=img/SMAP2.jpg>
</p>

**CALL TIME** gets the current date and time from an NTP server for display in BASIC. If a BASIC variable NTP$ with exactly 16 chars in size exists prior to the CALL, it will get assigned the NTP data:
<p align="center">
  <img width="576" src=img/TIME4.jpg>
</p>

**CALL ACHR** redefines the "lower capital" character definitions to true lower case. It's a bit of a bummer that BASIC constantly reloads the original definitions in command mode so you can really only enjoy lower case characters in a running program (**NB** see the notes on _Extended Basic_ further below): 
<p align="center">
  <img width="576" src=img/ACHR.jpg>
</p>
  
**CALL PDSK** and **CALL UDSK** apply or remove a virtual "sticker tab" (remember those?). With the "tab" applied, APEDSK99 can't write to the DSK. Under the hood the Protected flag at 0x10 in the Volume Information Block is set/reset:

</p>

- CALL LDSK list the files on a DOAD including the type (P)rogram / (D)isplay / (I)nternal and size in sectors. I always thought that was a really nice feature the C64 had.
- CALL MDSK maps DSK[1-3] to a DOAD. The DOAD file name is the DOS max 8 character part without the extension.  
- CALL RDSK removes a DOAD from the SD card. In line with BOFH standards no confirmation is required :-)
- CALL FGET and CALL FPUT load or save a DOAD from your FTP server of choice. Configuration on the APEDSK99 side is straightforward, with again just a couple of parameters in the CONFIG sketch. The FTP server side can be a bit more involved, especially regarding rights of the relevant FTP user for reading and writing in the /DISKS folder. FTP server logging is your friend here. 
- CALL ADSR loads a DSR file from / on the SD card and resets APEDSK99. If the DSR file doens't exist or is invalid the default file APEDSK99.DSR will be loaded instead. The current DSR filename is stored in EEPROM so will survive resets and powerdowns. ADSR may require a soft-reset to execute any DSR powerup routines. 

SDIR and LDSK may generate multiple screens of info. A ">" will show up at the bottom right for you to press either <SPACE> for the next screen or <ENTER> to go back to the TI-BASIC prompt.

Any unsuccessful CALL returns a generic "INCORRECT STATEMENT" error (or "SYNTAX ERROR" in _TI EXTENDED BASIC_) so check syntax, DOAD name etc.

All CALLs use a simple 2-way 18 byte buffer for data exchange at @>5FD6 in the DSR address space. It allows you to manipulate the buffer from assembly or BASIC's CALL LOAD and execute the relevant Arduino routine directly (see "*direct call examples*" in the documentation).
This lets _TI EXTENDED BASIC_ join the running program party as it only supports DSR CALL's from the "command prompt"

See the CALLs in action at ?

### *Updating the DSR*

I compile the DSR .a99 file with [xtd99 TI99 cross development tools](https://endlos99.github.io/xdt99/) and then use [this hex editor](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/) for padding the binary file with zero's to the full 8KB. After that it's just a matter of saving the binary file as APEDSK99.DSR in the root of the SD.

### *Uploading Sketches*

You should switch off the TI before uploading the APEDSK99 sketch from the Arduino IDE. If you don't, there is a good chance the Arduino bootloader gets corrupted and you'll need a second Arduino to restore it. Yes I have been there ... several times.  

Alternatively you could connect [_Analog 1_ to _+5V_](img/A15V.jpg) with a jumper wire before uploading; this disables the APEDSK99 sideport buffer IC's so you can leave the TI powered on. In fact, if you intend to put APEDSK99 in some sort of case, plan a switch for this. It's not only handy for uploading sketches but also for temporarily circumventing _TI EXTENDED BASIC_'s LOAD feature or preventing unintentional DSR RAM writes (see _**Ignition Sequence**_ below)

### *Ignition sequence*

Unlike the original TI Disk Controller ROM, the APEDSK99 DSR sits in RAM and is permanently enabled within the TI's address space. Any unintentional write from the TI can potentially corrupt the DSR code. This is likley to happen when you switch the TI on (spurious signals on the sideport).

So switch on the TI first, apply power to APEDSK99, wait a second for APEDSK99 to load the DSR (short flash from the LED) and then soft-reset the TI with FCTN-QUIT to execute the DSR power-up routines.

### *Error codes*

The LED can flash in the following intricate error patterns:

1. *flash*            : SPI / SD Card fault/not ready
2. *flash-flash*      : can't read DSR binary image (/xxxxxxxx.DSR)
3. *flash-flash-flash*: no valid DSR header (>AA) at DSR RAM >4000

### *I know*

Writing software is a hobby, not my profession. No doubt some gurus would achieve the same functionality with half the code. But I dare to say that at least the basic DSR I/O routines in the sketch are reasonably efficient, useful and fast. Anyway I am content with dusting off that stack of virtual floppies, have a beer and admire my work. 

Feel free to improve and share!

### *Bugs*

If a particular program or module behaves nicely by accessing disks solely through the regular DSR routines (including low level sector R/W) there shouldn't be any new ones (are there any existing disk controller bugs?) In other words, any funky index hole math or weird copy protection schemes will likely fail. 

### *Future*

After (of course) I came up with the name APEDSK99 I realised that DSK emulation is just a first application. The APEDSK99 shield is actually a generic interrupt-driven DSR interface to a substantial catalogue of available Arduino shields. Also, the Arduino has full access to the 32K RAM expansion so there is potential for fast data sharing between networked devices and the TI.

This project owes a lot to Thierry Nouspikel's marvelous [TI Tech Pages website](http://www.unige.ch/medecine/nouspikel/ti99/disks.htm) which has a wealth of information on the TI Disk Controller, including a commented disassembly of its DSR ROM.

Another great source of information has been Monty Schmidt's excellent book [Technical Drive](img/MSTDrive.jpg). Monty went on to do great things, check out [SoundForge](https://www.magix.com/us/music/sound-forge/).

The Arduino's serial-to-parallel RAM addressing scheme is neither new or mine but I have gratefully used part of [this excellent project](https://github.com/mkeller0815/MEEPROMMER) by Mario Keller.

Last but not least I virtually stumbled across my old friend Frederik "Fred" Kaal who I hadn't seen for 30 years after moving to the other side of the globe. Long live the Web and places such as AtariAge. Fred was a TI wizzard back then and [still very much is](http://ti99-geek.nl). His expert input has been of great help.
