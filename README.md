# APEDSK99
### *Arduino DSKx emulator shield for the TI99/4a*

APEDSK99 is an Arduino shield that emulates 3 DS/SD floppy drives for the TI99/4a home computer. It is used together with a SD card shield for storing Disk-On-A-Disk (DOAD) floppy images. The APEDSK99 shield plugs directly into the side port and is powered separately from a USB cable.

Like the TI, APEDSK99 is based on good old through-hole technology. I don't know about you but I don't get any pleasure from SMD soldering.

The TI shield interface is the familiar design, with 74LS241 buffers (actually they are 74LS541's, easier PCB layout) for address/control lines and a bi-directional 74LS245 buffer for the databus. An 8Kx8 RAM stores the DSR code. 

The DSR is based on the TI Disk Controller ROM, adapted to interface with a reliable SD card instead of wonky floppies. CRU is emulated through 2 memory mapped addresses, simplifying shield design. An 8KB binary DSR file is loaded into APEDSK99 RAM by the Arduino at powerup or reset. Various DSR optimisations have left about 3/4 KB available for _TI BASIC_ support and future enhancements. 

The Arduino UNO controls the TI interface, has R/W access to RAM, can halt the TI and tries to act as a FD1771. As GPIO pins are in rather short supply, Arduino RAM addressing is serial-to-parallel through 74HC595 shift registers. 

A LED (yellow or orange of course) shows both APEDSK99 access and error codes.

### *How does it work?*

When the TI issues a disk controller command by writing to one of the FD1771 registers, the Arduino receives an interrupt on one of its GPO pins. This interrupt is generated by a 74LS138 3->8 decoder which monitors the MBE*, WE* and A15 sideport signals. On receiving the interrupt, the Arduino then:

1. disables the sideport interface buffers
2. halts the TI by making READY low; this simultaneously enables the shift registers
3. enables the Arduino RAM control bus
4. executes the command including updating the relevant FD1771 and CRU "registers"
5. executes the opposite of steps 3, 1 and 2

### *Construction*

Putting the APEDSK99 shield together is straightforward and no problem for anybody with basic electronic skills. The 74LS541's and the slimline RAM are probably not stock items at your local electronics store but can be easily obtained online.

The KiCad files can be sent to your favourite online PCB maker (I use [JCLPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/)). 

The only thing that needs a little bit of attention is mounting the [edge connector](https://www.ebay.com/itm/5pc-Industrial-Card-Edge-Slot-Socket-Connector-22x2P-44P-2-54mm-0-1-3A-240-44/140888520037?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649):
- The bottom row of pins need to be bent 90 degrees downwards and the top row slightly bent upwards
- Rough up the bottom side of the connector housing and the PCB area it will sit on (between PCB edge and white line)
- Clean the 2 surfaces with isopropyl and apply dots of superglue across the length of 1 roughed up area
- Line up the bottom connector pins with the row of PCB holes marked 1-43 and press the connector firmly on the PCB, making sure all connector pins stick through to the soldering side. 

After clamping it for a while the bottom row pins can now be soldered. 

- The top row pins are soldered to the PCB via a suitable length of standard header.

The Arduino shield sandwich (UNO - APEDSK99 - SD) is attached to the TI sideport. I suggest you use some sort of padding between the UNO and your desk etc to prevent the stack from flapping in the breeze. It shouldn't be too hard to fit the stack into a neat little jiffy 
case.

### *DOAD's*

The SD card can be filled with as many DOAD's as you see fit :-) DOAD filenames must follow the MS-DOS 8.3 format and have a  ".DSK" extension. At powerup or reset the Arduino looks for optional "_DRIVE01.DSK" / "_DRIVE02.DSK" / "_DRIVE03.DSK" files and maps them accordingly so you can have your favourite apps ready to go. The DSR has support for DOAD management through TI BASIC CALL's. 

Once a DOAD is mapped to a particular DSK, it behaves very much like a normal (but quite fast) floppy. Single-sided formatting takes about 15 seconds and verifying is unnecesary. Fun fact: single-sided DOAD's automagically become double-sided by formatting them accordingly. Reverse is also true but the DOAD will still take DD / 180KB of space on the SD (not that it matters with plenty of GB's to spare).

### *TI BASIC support*

The DSR contains 4 additional TI BASIC CALL's to manage DOAD's:

- CALL PDSK( [1-3] ): This subprogram applies a virtual "adhesive tab" (remember those?) by setting a flag in the Volume Information Block, preventing APEDSK99 writing to the DOAD. Keep in mind that this is separate to the familiar _Protected_ flag as used by disk managers.

- CALL UDSK( [1-3] ): This subprogram removes the "tab"

- CALL CDSK( [1-3] ,"8 character DOAD name"): This subprogram maps DSK[1-3] to a DOAD. The DOAD name must be 8 characters, padded with spaces if shorter.

- CALL SDSK( [1-3] ): This subprogram displays the current DOAD mapping for the relevant drive. 

Any unsuccessful CALL returns a generic "INCORRECT STATEMENT" error ("SYNTAX ERROR" in _TI EXTENDED BASIC_) so check syntax, DOAD name/length etc.

One thing to keep in mind with _TI EXTENDED BASIC_ is that DSR CALL's don't work from a running program, only from the "command prompt". _TI BASIC_ is not that picky.

### *Updating the DSR*

I compile the DSR .a99 file with [xtd99 TI99 cross development tools](https://endlos99.github.io/xdt99/) and then use [this hex editor](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/) for padding the binary file with zero's to the full 8KB. After that it's just a matter of saving the binary file as APEDSK99.DSR in the root of the SD.

### *Uploading Sketches*

You should switch off the TI before uploading the APEDSK99 sketch from the Arduino IDE. If you don't, there is a good chance the Arduino bootloader gets corrupted and you'll need a second Arduino to restore it. Yes I have been there ... several times.  

Alternatively you could connect _Analog 1_ to _+5V_ with a jumper wire before uploading; this disables the APEDSK99 sideport buffer IC's so you can leave the TI powered on. In fact, if you intend to put APEDSK99 in some sort of case, plan a switch for this. It's not only handy for uploading sketches but also for temporarily circumventing _TI EXTENDED BASIC_'s LOAD feature or preventing unintentional DSR RAM writes (see _**Ignition Sequence**_ below)

### *Ignition sequence*

Unlike the original TI Disk Controller ROM, the APEDSK99 DSR sits in RAM and is permanently enabled within the TI's address space. An unintentional write from the TI can potentially corrupt the DSR code. This could happen for instance when you switch the TI on (spurious signals on the sideport) or insert a cartridge.

So switch thon e TI first, apply power to APEDSK99, wait a second for APEDSK99 to load the DSR (short glow from the LED) and then soft-reset the TI with FCTN-QUIT.

### *Error codes*

The LED flashes in the following intricate patterns to indicate various error conditions:

flash                   : SPI / SD Card fault/not ready
flash-flash             : can't read DSR binary image (/APEDSK.DSR)
flash-flash-flash       : no valid DSR header (>AA) at DSR RAM >4000

### *Bug's*

If a particular program or module behaves nicely by accessing disks solely through the regular DSR routines there shouldn't be any new ones (are there any existing disk controller bugs?) In other words, any funky direct disk access and weird copy protection schemes will likely fail. 

### *Future*

After (of course) I came up with the name APEDSK99 I brainwaved that DSK emulation is just a first application. The shield is actually a generic DSR interface to a substantial catalogue of available Arduino shields ... including very useful ones such as Ethernet / WiFi. Instead of trying to squeeze a tiny SLIP stack into the TI's meager memory, a revised DSR and the base routines in the APEDSK99 Arduino sketch will achieve this quite easily.

initially I considered using a bigger RAM size for larger and/or concurrent DSR's. But after optimising  Arduino RAM R/W access I had DSR loading times reduced to ~450ms so switching DSR's based on CALL's would be entirely feasible. I will go with that approach for now.

This project owes a lot to Thierry Nouspikel's marvelous [TI Tech Pages website](http://www.unige.ch/medecine/nouspikel/ti99/disks.htm) which has a wealth of information on the TI Disk Controller, including a commented disassembly of its DSR ROM.

Another great source of information has been Monthy Schmidt's excellent book "Technical Drive". Monty went on to do great things, check out [SoundForge](https://www.magix.com/us/music/sound-forge/).

The Arduino's serial-to-parallel RAM addressing scheme is neither new or mine but I have gratefully used part of [this excellent project](https://github.com/mkeller0815/MEEPROMMER) by Mario Keller.

Last but not least I virtually stumbled across my old friend Frederik "Fred" Kaal who I hadn't seen for 30 years after moving to the other side of the globe. Long live the Web and places such as AtariAge. Fred was a TI wizzard back then and [still very much is](http://ti99-geek.nl). His expert input has been a great help.
