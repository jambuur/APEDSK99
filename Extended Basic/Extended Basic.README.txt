Unlike TI BASIC, EXBAS can't execute DSR ROM CALL's in a running program (command mode is fine).
This DSK has a convenient workaround. By loading an assembly object file you will get
CALL LINK hooks to all APEDSK99 CALL's.

Some examples:

	TI BASIC			TI Extended BASIC
	--------			-----------------
	10 CALL "AHLP"			10 CALL LINK("AHLP")
	20 CALL PDSK(1)			20 CALL LINK("PDSK",1)
	30 CALL MDSK(1,"AD99XB")	30 CALL LINK("MDSK",1,"AD99XB")
	40 CALL FGET("ACFG")		40 CALL LINK("FGET","ACFG")
