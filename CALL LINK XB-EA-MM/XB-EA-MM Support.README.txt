Unlike TI BASIC, EXBAS can't execute DSR ROM CALL's in a running program (command mode is fine).
This DSK has a convenient workaround. By loading an assembly object file you will get
CALL LINK hooks to all APEDSK99 CALL's.

A member of the Italian TI user group (thanks Fabrizio!) pointed out that with CALL LINK you can use variables for any APEDSK99 CALL values (e.g. CALL LINK(CMD$,VAL$) instead of CALL LINK("LDSK",1). 
This is a major benefit so I added CALL LINK support for Editor/Assembler and Mini Memory as well.

Some examples:

	TI BASIC			XB / EA / MM
	--------			-----------------
	10 CALL "AHLP"			10 CALL LINK("AHLP")
	20 CALL PDSK(1)			20 CALL LINK("PDSK",1)
	30 CALL MDSK(1,"AD99SUP")	30 CALL LINK("MDSK",1,"AD99SUP")
	40 CALL FGET("AD99SUP")		40 CALL LINK("FGET","AD99SUP")

To use, map AD99SSUP.DSK to any drive (this example uses DSK1) and load the object file (NB: for E/A you will need to load the BASIC support routines first):

	>CALL MDSK(1,"AD99SUP")
	>CALL INIT
	>CALL LOAD("DSK1.BSCSUP")	<- only for E/A
	>CALL LOAD("DSK1.AD99XB")
